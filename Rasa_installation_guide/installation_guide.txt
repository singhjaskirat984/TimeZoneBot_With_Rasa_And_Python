Quick Installation----

$ pip3 install rasa




------------------Step-by-step Installation Guide-------------------------------
1. Install the Python development environment-
   $ python3 --version
   $ pip3 --version
   If these packages are already installed, these commands should display version numbers for each step, and you can skip    to the next step.
   Otherwise, proceed with the instructions below to install them.
   C:\> pip3 install -U pip

2. Create a virtual environment (strongly recommended)-
   Tools like virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper provide isolated Python environments, which are cleaner than installing    packages systemwide (as they prevent dependency conflicts). They also let you install packages without root privileges.

   Create a new virtual environment by choosing a Python interpreter and making a .\venv directory to hold it:
   C:\> python3 -m venv ./venv

   Activate the virtual environment:
   C:\> .\venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install Rasa Open Source-

   First make sure your pip version is up to date:
   $ pip install -U pip

   To install Rasa Open Source:
   $ pip install rasa
